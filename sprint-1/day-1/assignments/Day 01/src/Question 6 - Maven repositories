Q6.What are the different types of Maven repositories?

--A maven repository is a directory of packaged JAR file with pom.xml file. 
Maven searches for dependencies in the repositories. In simple words, a repository is a
store where maven maintains plugins, archetypes, and lots of jar files used for building
different kinds of java projects.

There are 3 types of maven 
repository:

1. Local Repository
2. Central Repository
3. Remote Repository

Maven searches for the dependencies in the following order:
Local repository then Central repository then Remote repository.


If dependency is not found in these repositories, maven stops processing 
and throws an error.

1) Maven Central Repository-
	It is the maven's own repository in which it maintains all kinds of project related
	plugins, archetypes, jars etc.
	https://repo1.maven.org/maven2
	
2) Maven Remote Repository-
	This repository is maintained within the organization for sharing plugins, archetypes
	and jar files for multiple projects within organizations ex. masairepo.
	
3) Maven Local Repository-
	This repository will be created inside the developer computer. (.m2) is the name
	for this repository.
