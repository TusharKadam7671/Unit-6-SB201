Q4. Explain about the basic properties of pom.xml file.

Answer-

--POM is acronym for Project Object Model. The pom.xml file contains information of project
and configuration information for the maven to build the project such as dependencies,
build directory, source directory, test source directory, plugin, goals etc.

--Maven reads the pom.xml file, then executes the goal.

--Basic properties or elements of the pom.xml file-

For creating the simple pom.xml file, you need to have following elements:
1.project: It is the root element of pom.xml file.
2.modelVersion: It is the sub element of project. It specifies the modelVersion. It should be set to 4.0.0.
3.groupId: It is the sub element of project. It specifies the id for the project group.
4.artifactId: It is the sub element of project. It specifies the id for the artifact (project). 
An artifact is something that is either produced or used by a project. Examples of artifacts produced 
by Maven for a project include: JARs, source and binary distributions, and WARs.
5.version: It is the sub element of project. It specifies the version of the artifact under given group.

Maven pom.xml file with additional elements
Here, we are going to add other elements in pom.xml file such as:

1.packaging: defines packaging type such as jar, war etc.
2.name: defines name of the maven project.
3.url: defines url of the project.
4.dependencies: defines dependencies for this project.
dependency: defines a dependency. It is used inside dependencies.
5.scope: defines scope for this maven project. It can be compile, provided, runtime, test and system.
