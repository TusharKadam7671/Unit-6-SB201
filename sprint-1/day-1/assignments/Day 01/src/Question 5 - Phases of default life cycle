Q5. What are the different phases of the default life cycle?

Answer-

Maven build life cycle contains different phases-

1. Validate- in this phase it will verify the project directory structure is valid or
not and it has pom.xml file is there or not.

2. Compile- Maven compile all the source code of the project by downloading and adding
required jar files in the classpath.

3. Test-compile- If we have written any unit test cases those code will be compiled.

4. Test- Maven will run all the test cases and it will show how many test cases are
success and how many fails.

5. Package- Maven will bundle our java code into a jar file inside 'target' folder.

6. Install- that jar file in step 5 will be stored in the local repository.

7. Deploy- Maven stores the application jar file to the central repository.

8. Clean- here maven will delete and remove all the files that are generated in previous
build. This phasw is an isolated phase.
