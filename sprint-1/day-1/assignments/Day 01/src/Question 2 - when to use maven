Q2. When should one use Maven?

Answer-

--Build automation is the act of scripting or automating a wide variety of tasks
that software developers do in their day-to-day activities.

--In small projects, developers will often manually invoke the build process.

--This is not practical for larger projects, where it is very hard to keep track of 
what needs to be built,in what sequence and what dependencies there are in the 
building process. Using an automation tool allows the build process to be more consistent.

--So, in these case build tools like ANT,Maven,Gradle are used.

--Maven is a tool that can now be used for building and managing any Java-based project. It makes the day-to-day
work of Java developers easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java-based project.

--Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects
build, dependency and documentation.

--In Maven, a dependency is just another archive—JAR, ZIP, and so on—which our current project needs in order
to compile, build, test, and/or run. These project dependencies are collectively specified in the pom. xml file,
inside of a <dependencies> tag.
