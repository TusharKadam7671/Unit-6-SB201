● Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate.
● Explain the Life-cycle of Entity class with example.

Answer-

Q1)difference between JPA and Hibernate.

JPA-
1.described in javax.persistence package
2.not an implementation. It is only specification.
3.It uses JPQL i.e. java persistence query language
4.It uses EntityManager interface


Hibernate-
1.described in org.hibernate package
2.implementation of JPA.
3.It uses HQL i.e. Hibernate query language.
4.It uses SessionFactory interface.



Q2)Life cycle of Entity class-

There are three life cycle states of an entity class
1.Transient
2.Persistance
3.Detached

1.transient state
-initial state of an object, once we create instance of pojo class
object enters in transient state
--transient object exist in heap memory

Employee emp = new Employee(); //here object enters in transient state
emp.setId(12);

2.Persistence state-
-as soon as object associsted with session it enters into persistence state
-any modification in data changes in database
	session.persist(emp); 
	or
	em.persist(emp);
	
3.Detached state-
-once we close session or clear its cache object enters in detached state
-to again attach object to the hibernate session we have to use merge()
load() like methods.
-session.close();
session.clear()
