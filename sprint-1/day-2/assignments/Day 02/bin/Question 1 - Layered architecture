Q1-> Explain Layared Architecture in Business application

Answer-

1.Maintaining the business data in secure and easily retrival manner.
-the logic that we write to implement this part of business application is know as
Data Access Logic.

2.Processing the data according to the bussiness rule-
-the logic that we write to implement this part of business application is known as 
Business/Service logic.

3.Presenting the data to the user in user-understandable format
-the logic that we write to implement this part of bussiness application is known as
Presentation logic.

	the above 3 logics are required for almost every business application.
	
class MyBusinessApplication
{

	//Data Access Logic //fetch the account information from the DB.
	//Business Logic //calculating the Interest to the balance.
	//Presentation Logic //display the information to the client

}

-We can write all 3 logics to develop a business application in one program/class
itself, if we do so, the following problem we will face:

1.All the logics to develop the application will be mixed up with each other (no clear
code separation)
2.Modification done in one logic may affect the othe logic
3.Logics will depend upon each other so parallel development will not be possible
4.Testing each logic is also will become complex

	to solve this problems, a java based business application, we devide into 3 logical
partition depending upon the  role played by each part and each part we say 
as a layer-

1.Presentation Layer (UI Layer)
2.Bussiness Logic Layer (Service Layer)
3.Data Access Layer

1.Presentation layer-
	It is set of java classes, which are responsible for generating user input screen
and response page(output screen) is known as presentation layer.
	This layer provides the interaction with the end-user.
	
2.Business/Service logic layer-
	Programatical implementation of business rule of a business organization is nothing
but business logic
	A collection of java classes whose methods have business logic to process the data
according to the businesss rule is known as Business/Service layer.

3.Data Access Layer-
	A set of java classes whose methods are exclusively meant for performing CRUD 
operation with the DB server is known as Data Access Layer.
