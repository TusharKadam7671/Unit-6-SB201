Q2.limitation of JDBC based persistence logic over JPA

Answer-

1.JDBC can't store the java objects into the table directly, because sql queries does
not allows the java object as input, here we need to convert object data into the simple
(atomic) value to store them in a Data Base.

2.JDBC code is the DB dependent code because it uses DB s/w dependent queries. So our
jdbc based persostence logic is not 100% portable across various DB s/w.

3.JDBC code having boiler plate code problem (writing the same code except sql queties
in multiple classes of our application again and again)

4.JDBC code throws lots of checked exceptions, programmer need to hangle them.

5.After the select operation, we get the ResultSet object. This resultset object can not
transfer from one layer to another layer and to get the data from the ResultSet we need
to now the structure of the ResultSet.

6.There is no any caching and transaction management support is available in jdbc
