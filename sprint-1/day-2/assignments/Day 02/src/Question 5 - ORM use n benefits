Q5. Why to use ORM and What are the benefits of ORM?

Answer-

--We have used SQL database in our application and we used SQL queries to update, insert
or retrieve the data, no matter how tough the queries are. So, from here idea of Object
Relational Mapping(ORM) comes. 
--And it is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type 
systems using object-oriented programming language.

--With ORM we can write database queries usign object oriented paradigm of our preferred
language and there are many free and commercial packages available that perform object
relational mapping.

--ORM sets the mapping between the set of objects which are written in the preferred
programming language and relational database like SQL.
--It hides and encapsulates the SQL queries into objects and instead of SQL queries we
can use directly the objects to implement the SQL query.

Why to use ORM-
1.We get to write in the language we already using. It is sometimes tough to write SQL
queries directly as they are complicated in some cases. So, to maintain the fluency
we use ORM.
2.It hides the SQL or any other database query away from your application logic.
3.For heavy database usege like creating 10+ tables and using many queries in them, then
it is good to use ORM as it reduce the code and give better understanding of the code to
you and your team mates.
4.It makes your application faster and easier to maintain.

Benefits of ORM-
1.Speeds-up development- eliminates the need for repetitive SQL code.
2.Reduces development time.
3.Reduces development cost.
4.Overomes vendor specific SQL differences- the ORM knows how to write vendor specific
SQL so you dont have to.
