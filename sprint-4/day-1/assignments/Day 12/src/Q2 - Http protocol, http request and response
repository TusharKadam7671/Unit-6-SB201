client could be one of the following:
1.browser s/w
2.Postman s/w
3.swagger s/w
4.angular app
5.react app

HTTP request structure:

this request is distributed in three parts

2)request header
3)request body

there is GET,POST,PUT,DELETE this four methods is there. we can select any of above method

->second part is uri in that we have to write the page name .uri means universal
resource identifier that identify your html page which will be deploy in web browser.

->The last part is version in that we select the http browser ex-1.1,2.x etc

2)
->Second part is request header in that there is data in key value pair
where key is fixed and value will change as per client request.

1. Date : date and time on which request is made from the client.
2. Host: ipaddress of the client.
3. user-agent: from which browser the client has generated the request.
4.content-type: type of the data coming from the request body (json, txt, xml, pdf, jpg)
5.connection : live or lost(used in social medial platform to show you are online or not)
6.cookies: name-value pair text (store you preference)

we can create our headers also 

3)
-> third  part is Request body in which we send the data as per client requirement
in json or xml or in any other format.GET and DELETE method doesn't have any request
body.
