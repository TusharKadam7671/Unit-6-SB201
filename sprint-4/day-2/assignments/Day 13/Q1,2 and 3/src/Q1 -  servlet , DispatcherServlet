		Servlet-
		
--Servlet : it is a java class in which we write html code inside (it will generate dynamic html)

--Servlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server.

--They are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce the response, 
then send a response back to the webserver. 

--Properties of Servlets are as follows:

	~Servlets work on the server-side.
	~Servlets are capable of handling complex requests obtained from the webserver.

		Role of the DispatcherServlet-
		
--Spring f/w provides Spring-web-mvc module to simplify the manual mvc application development.
in which , Spring mvc module provides a predefined Servlet class with predefined flow control logic , 
ie. DispatcherServlet class.

--DispatcherServlet acts as front controller for Spring based web applications. 

--It provides a mechanism for request processing where actual work is performed by configurable, delegate components. 

--It is inherited from javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet, it is typically configured in the web.xml file.

--A web application can define any number of DispatcherServlet instances. 

--Each servlet will operate in its own namespace, loading its own application context with mappings, handlers, etc. 

--Only the root application context as loaded by ContextLoaderListener, if any, will be shared. 

--In most cases, applications have only single DispatcherServlet with the context-root URL(/), that is, all 
requests coming to that domain will be handled by it.

--DispatcherServlet uses Spring configuration classes to discover the delegate components it needs for 
request mapping, view resolution, exception handling etc.
