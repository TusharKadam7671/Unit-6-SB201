Q2/- Explain the difference between Spring-MVC and Spring Boot.

Answer-

Spring MVC-

1.Spring MVC is a Model, View, and controller based framework used to build web application.
2.This framework requires a lot of configurations, such as DispatcherServlet configurations
and view Resolver configurations.
3.Every dependency needs to be specified separately for be specified separately for the 
features to run.
4.Spring MVC helps to develop applications easily.
5.The time required for development is more as compared to Spring Boot because developers
need to devote time to adding required dependencies.
6.The productivity gets reduced since one needs to understand the dependency add-ons.
7.Spring MVC requires a lot of manual configurations into the feature for JAR packaging.
8.A deployment descriptor is required for the Spring MVC framework.
9.The four components of Spring MVC are Model, View, Controller, and Front Controller(
DispatcherServlet)
10.Spring MVC is only designed to develop dynamic web pages and RESTful web services.
11.It does not provide powerful batch processing.
12.It is necessary to build the configuration manually if we are using Spring MVC.
13.Spring MVC requires a deployment descriptor.
14.Each dependency is specified separately in Spring MVC.
15.The spring MVC framework requires more time for development.
16.There is no powerful batch processing feature in Spring MVC.

Spring Boot-

1.Spring Boot is one of the most widely used frameworks in the REST API development field.
It is developed on top of the conventional spring framework. It is used to build 
stand-alone web spring applications.
2.Spring Boot has the configurations automatically with its Auto-configuration feature.
3.Spring Boot has the concept of starters, once it is added to the classpath, it will
bring all the dependencies needed for dependencies needed for the dependencies needed
for developing a web application.
4.Spring Boot helps to develop the applications easily and quickly with features like
auto-configuration and starters.
5.Spring Boot helps in reducing the development time as all the dependency-related task gets
handled.
6.Since the development time is less, productivity increases.
7.Spring Boot allows the embedded server to run the feature in a stand-alone manner.
8.A deployment descriptor is not required for the Spring Boot framework.
9.The four layers of Spring Boot are the Presentation layer, Business layer, Persistence
layer, and Database layer.
10.Spring Boot allows building different other kinds of applications too.
11.It provides powerful batch processing.
12.Spring Boot eliminates the need to manually build the configuration.
13.Spring Boot does not require deployment descriptors.
14.In Spring Boot, all dependencies are wrapped together in a single unit.
15.The Spring Boot framework reduces development time and increases productivity at 
the same time.
16.The Spring Boot framework provides powerful batch processing capabilities.
