Q3/- What is the difference between setter injection and constructor injection?

Answer-

Constructor injection-
-It may cause circular dependency.
-If the dependency is mandatory.
-If the dependency is "final" variable then it must be injected through the
constructor injection only.
-Constructor injected values will be accessible to setter method.
-Constructor injected value can not override the setter injected value.
-It is not much readable in comparison to the setter.
-It always creates a new bean instance.
-It supports immutability.

Setter injection-
-It resolves the circular dependency.
-If the dependency is optional.
-We can not inject the final variable through the constructor.
-Setter injected value can not be accessible through the constructor.
-It can override the constructor injected value.
-It is more readable.
-It does not create any new bean instance.
-It does not support.
