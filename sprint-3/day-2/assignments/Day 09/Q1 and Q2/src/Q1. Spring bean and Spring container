-They are the objects forming the backbone of the user's application and are managed
by the Spring IoC container.

container (by means of XML or java annotations configurations.)

Spring Container-
-Spring container forms the core of the Spring framework. 
-In spring application, A pure java class that controls all the spring beans is known
 as a spring container.
-The Spring container uses Dependency Injection (DI) for managing the application 
components by creating objects, wiring them together along with configuring and 
managing their overall life cycles.
-The instructions for the spring container to do the tasks can be provided either by
XML configuration, Java annotations, or Java code.
