Q1/- What is the J2EE, list out some of the Application Server names.

Answer-

J2EE-

--J2EE stands for Java 2 platform, Enterprise Edition. J2EE is the standard platform
for developing application in the enterprise and in designed for enterprise applications
that run on servers.

--J2EE provides APIs that let developers create workflow and make use of resources such
as database or web services. J2EE consists of a set of APIs. Developers can use these
APIs to build application for business computing.

--A J2EE application server is software that runs applications built with J2EE APIs and
lets you run multiple applications on a single computer. Developers can use different
J2EE application servers to run applications built with J2EE APIs.

--Benefits of J2EE-
1.Portability- If you build a J2EE application on a specific platform, it runs the same
way on any other J2EE-compliant platform.
2.Reusability- The components in J2EE are reused, so the average size of an application
is much smaller than it would be if you had to write equivalent functionality from 
scratch for each program.
3.Security- Java technology lets  programmers handle sensitive data far more securely
than they can in C/C++ programs.
4.Scalability- J2EE lets developers build application that run well on both small,
single-processor computers and large, multi-processor systems.
5.Reliability- Many of the services (such as transaction management and monitoring)
that applications need to be reliable are built into J2EE.

Application server- 

--Application servers provide a framework to build and deploy web applications and offer
a variety of services when running such applications.
--These services include security, transactions, clustering for increased performance,
and diagnostic capabilities, among others. These products can also include servers that
strictly host web applications.
--Application servers are used by software developers who are trying to quickly build
applications and have them supported by the server environment in which they are deployed.
