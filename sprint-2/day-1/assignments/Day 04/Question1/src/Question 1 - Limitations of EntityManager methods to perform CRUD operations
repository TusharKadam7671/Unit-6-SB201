Q1/- What are the limitations of EntityManager methods to perform CRUD operations with
DB?

Answer-

-EntityManager have the following methods-
Persist(), find(), merge(), and remove()

-but these methods have following limitations while performing CRUD operations with database-

1.Retriving Entity object based on only ID field (Primary key field) @ID.
2.Multiple Entity object retrival is not possible (multiple record).
3.Bulk update and bulk delete is also not possible.
4.To access Entity object we can not specify some extra condition.

-To overcome the above limitation JPA has provided JPQL(Java Persistence Query Language).
