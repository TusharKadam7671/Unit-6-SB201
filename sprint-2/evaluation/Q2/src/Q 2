â€“Differentiate between Hibernate and JPA

JPA-

1.JPA is described in javax.persistence package
2.It is not an implementation it is only a java specification.
3.It is a standard API that used to perform database operations.
4.It uses Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL)
5.To interconnect with the entity manager factory  it uses
EntityManagerFactory interface.


Hibernate-

1.Hibernate is described in org.hibernate package.
2.Hibernate is an implementation of JPA.
3.It is used in mapping Java data types with SQL data types and database tables.
4.It uses Hibernate Query Language (HQL) to execute
database operations.
5.To create Session instances, it uses SessionFactory interface.



Advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC-

-store/persist java object to DB directly
-ORM persistence logic is platform independent
-exception handling is optional because throws unchecked exception
-prevent from boiler plate coding to perform CRUD operations
-provides caching mechanism
-supports pojo/poji model
-provides implicit connection pooling
-has special query language known as JPQL
-generates fine tuned SQL queries internally and improves performance
